# RL_3DPlace
RL_3DPlace is a reinforcement learning-based placement framework for monolithic 3D integrated circuits (ICs). It leverages the Poetry package manager for dependency management and execution.

📌 Features
Poetry-based setup for dependency management
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for 3D IC placement
Benchmark support for various designs
Customizable execution for specific designs

🚀 Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/abdullahmansoor/RL_3DPlace.git
cd RL_3DPlace


2. Install Dependencies using Poetry
Ensure you have Poetry installed. If not, install it via:

pip install poetry

Then, install dependencies:
poetry install



🏃Running the Project
