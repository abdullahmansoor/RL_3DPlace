# RL_3DPlace
RL_3DPlace is a reinforcement learning-based placement framework for monolithic 3D integrated circuits (ICs). It leverages the Poetry package manager for dependency management and execution.

## 📌 Features
Poetry-based setup for dependency management
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for 3D IC placement
Benchmark support for various designs
Customizable execution for specific designs

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/abdullahmansoor/RL_3DPlace.git
cd RL_3DPlace
```

3. Install Dependencies using Poetry
Ensure you have Poetry installed. If not, install it via:
```
pip install poetry
```
Then, install dependencies:
```
poetry install
```

## 🏃Running the Project

1. Run Default Placement Flow
```   
poetry run python src/rl_3dplace/DHARL_flow.py
```
3. Run Placement for a Specific Design
```   
poetry run python src/rl_3dplace/DHARL_flow.py -designName \<designName\>
```

- rlcase1
- muxshifter4
- muxshifter8
- muxshifter16
- muxshifter16b
- muxshifter32
- muxshifter64
